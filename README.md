### About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://triskele-healing.com/)

My first site using Vue.JS. I love React, but thought I should try other front-end frameworks before deciding it's my favourite. Also my first time using SCSS. Who knew CSS could look so tidy? I'm definitely an SCSS convert, but still not sure if I prefer Vue to React. (I've since begun a larger project in Vue to further explore its capabilities.)

Anyway, this small, static site was much improved with Vue's reusable components, replacing the previous HTML-only repeated navigation. I also added semantic HMTL for improved accessibility, and CSS responsive design so it looks great on different screen sizes. And the client was happy, so that's the main thing.
