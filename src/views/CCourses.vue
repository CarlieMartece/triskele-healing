        <h2>Ear Candling</h2>
        <p>
          This fascinating therapy has gained popularity in recent years as we
          seek natural forms of healthcare. Ear Candling is a gentle,
          non-invasive therapy that is easy to perform and beneficial to
          receive. It is soothing and helpful for conditions experienced by many
          of us - such as headaches, compacted ear wax, sinus problems,
          tinnitus, pressure problems and much more. It is also a very relaxing
          therapy in its own right and helpful with the treatment of stress.

        <h2>Indian Head Massage</h2>
        <p>
          Indian Head Massage is highly effective, convenient and one of the
          most popular therapies available today. A treatment includes massage
          of the upper back, shoulders, arms, neck, scalp, face and energy
          balancing. Clients are not required to undress and no special
          equipment is needed, making treatments accessible to many. A full
          treatment takes 30 minutes but in some circumstances (e.g. for
          corporate clients) 15 or 20 minute sessions are popular.
