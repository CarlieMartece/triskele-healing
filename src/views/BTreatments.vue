        <h2>Ayurvedic Kansa Vatki (KV) Foot Massage™</h2>
        <h3>50 minutes, £28</h3>
        <p>
          Kansa Vatki (KV) Foot Massage™ with marma therapy (Indian acupressure)
          is an ancient Ayurvedic health-care modality, which balances the body,
          mind and spirit. This unique treatment, steeped in centuries of
          ceremony, involves the use of ghee (clarified butter) or oils. The
          massage is deeply revitalising for tired feet and legs and, as the
          feet contain key energy and nerve endings relating to internal organs,
          a Kansa Vatki treatment also helps to rebalance the doshas (Vata,
          Pitta and Kapha energies).
        </p>
        <p>
          The treatment begins by cleansing the feet, followed by some relaxing
          foot and leg moves. Slowly and methodically the toes, feet, ankles and
          calves are helped to relax. The treatment continues with special moves
          performed with the small 3-metal Kansa Vatki bowl. This is followed by
          a re-balancing sequence of marma massage (Indian acupressure).
        </p>
        <p>
          All this special attention helps to detoxify and balance the body's
          energies leaving you feeling refreshed and relaxed. This treatment is
          good for everyone and ideal for those who spend long hours on their
          feet.

        <h2>Ear Candling</h2>
        <h3>45 minutes, £25</h3>
        <p>
          Hopi ear candles are named after the Native American Indians who first
          introduced this gentle therapy to the modern age. The Hopi people are
          renowned for their extensive knowledge of healing and their spiritual
          lifestyle. Ear candles are still made today on the basis of their old
          traditional formula with ingredients including beeswax, honey and
          sage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ear Candling relieves pressure and pain, mainly in the ear and head
          area. It is soothing and helpful for conditions such as headache,
          compacted ear wax, sinus problems, tinnitus and more, and is a very
          relaxing therapy in its own right. An ear candling treatment includes
          a massage of the face, ears, neck and scalp.

        <h2>Facial Rejuvenation</h2>
        <h3>45 minutes, £28</h3>
        <p>
          Facial Rejuvenation is a natural facelift with massage. It is designed
          to be a gentle non-invasive approach to looking younger. It works
          primarily by freeing constrictions both within the facial muscles and
          in the connective tissue. Tension can build up within our facial
          muscles from the pressures of everyday life without us realising it.
          It can be easy for certain thoughts and emotions to become habitual,
          locking them into expressions on our face. Under such conditions
          muscles can actually 'dry up' and contract, inhibiting freedom of
          expression. This can encourage the formation of wrinkles as the face
          loses its muscle tone and elasticity and begins to sag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through a combination of gentle massage of the face, energy balancing
          and facial exercises, the facial muscles are given a new lease of
          life. Although it is difficult to stave off the ageing process, Facial
          Rejuvenation can do much to extend the appearance of youth and beauty
          and help us to take care of the assets we possess.

        <h2>Hot Stone Therapy</h2>
        <h3>1 hour, £35</h3>
        <p>
          The application of water-heated basalt stones, hot stone therapy
          targets key points on the body, giving a deep massage and creating
          sensations of comfort and warmth. The direct heat that hot stone
          therapy provides, relaxes muscles allowing manipulation of a greater
          intensity than with regular massage. A Hot Stone therapy massage
          expands the blood vessels and pushes blood and unwanted waste
          materials through the body. This has a sedative effect on the nervous
          system. The stones are put on the chakra points of the body along the
          spine. The chakra points are the body's energy center. It is believed
          to vitalize the physical body. When stimulated, it balances energy
          flow throughout the body.

        <p>
          Indian Head Massage is based on the traditional form of head massage
          practiced in India for over 1,000 years. This therapy is sometimes
          referred to as 'Champissage', a Hindi word meaning 'Head Massage' from
          which the word 'shampoo' is derived.<br /><br />
          It includes massage of the upper back, arms, neck, shoulders, scalp
          and face. It requires no undressing or use of oil, so it can even be
          performed in the workplace without having to leave your chair.

        <p>
          The Natural Facial uses a combination of massage techniques with the
          application of nature's storehouse- flower waters and carrier oils
          from trees, shrubs, flowers, fruits, nuts and seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The face is cleansed and toned using natural products. A warm compress
          is applied to open pores and aid absorption of oils into the skin.
          Then a natural mask is applied to draw out any impurities. The
          treatment is finished by a gentle massage to the face and neck using
          carrier oils selected to suit the client's skin type.

        <h2>Reflexology</h2>
        <h3>1 hour, £30</h3>
        <p>
          Reflexology is an ancient art, which works on the principle that there
          are reflex points on the feet that correspond and connect to all the
          glands, organs and parts of the body. By using gentle pressure
          techniques to stimulate these reflexes, the body is encouraged to heal
          itself naturally, often counteracting a lifetime of misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following illness, stress, injury or disease, the body is in a state
          of imbalance and vital energy pathways are blocked, preventing the
          body from functioning effectively. Reflexology can help by restoring
          the energy flow, eliminating toxins, improving blood circulation,
          relieving tension and inducing a deep state of relaxation.
